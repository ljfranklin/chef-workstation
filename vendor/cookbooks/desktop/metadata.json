This LWRP let you manage the keys and values\nfor those settings.\n\nRight now it's just supported **gconf** and **gsettings**, but I hope that more\ndesktop settings systems be supported in the future. For example, the one\nused by _KDE_.\n\nThis LWRP born as a need for a project called [GECOS](http://forja.guadalinex.org/plugins/mediawiki/index.php?group_id=105) which is being developed\nby the **Junta de Andalucía**, a local government from the lovely region of Spain:\nAndalusia.\n\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nIn order to use this LWRP from your cookbook or recipe you need to add\nthis cookbook as a dependency at the `metadata.rb` file.\n\nAfter doing that you can do things like:\n\n```ruby\nnode['my_cookbook']['users'].each do |username|\n  desktop_settings \"picture-uri\" do\n    schema   \"org.gnome.desktop.background\"\n    type     \"string\"\n    value    \"/usr/share/background/supecoolbackgroung.jpg\"\n    user     username\n  end\nend\n```\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTo see how this works and how could be used from another cookbook, let's see\nsome examples.\n\nThe LWRP provider by default is `gsettings` as this is the new kid on the block\nand the current default system for GNOME and GNOME apps.\nIf you like to set a specific background to an user you could do something like:\n\nLet's say we have a recipe named `background` with this at the `attributes.rb`:\n\n```ruby\ndefaults['background']['image'] = '/usr/share/background/supecoolbackgroung.jpg'\ndefaults['background']['user']  = 'joe'\n```\n\nAnd this inside the recipe:\n\n```ruby\ndesktop_settings \"picture-uri\" do\n  schema   \"org.gnome.desktop.background\"\n  type     \"string\"\n  value    node['background']['image']\n  user     node['background']['user']\nend\n```\n\nBut we can use also the `gconf` provider to set the _background_ is this is\nthe setting system that use our desktop:\n\n```ruby\ndesktop_settings '/desktop/gnome/background/picture_filename' do\n  type     'string'\n  value    node['background']['image']\n  user     node['background']['user']\n  provider 'desktop_gconf'\nend\n```\n\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\nAuthors:\n\n* Roberto C.
